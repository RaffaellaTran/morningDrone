# Morning Drone

This repository contains the code of the MorningDrone mobile app for the university course ICT Innovation for 2016/2017 at University of Trento.

The project consists in a very small, affordable and safe drone that effectively 
wakes up the user through an awesome and easy-drone experience.
The drone is connected with an alarm mobile application. 
The user set the alarm clock on the mobile app. When the alarm rings, the drone
actually flies around in the user's room and he/she has to interact with it in
order to switch off.

## Morning Drone Mobile App

The mobile app is a simple alarm clock for only Android devices.
It sends a message to the drone when the alarm rings through the Bluetooth and receives a message when the drone is catched 
by the user.
